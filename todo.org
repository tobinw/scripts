  - [X] move to AMOS
  - [X] queue run
* TODO [5/5] add follow force to simMacro attdefs
  DEADLINE: <2016-02-05 Fri>
  - [X] email cameron about language spec
  - [X] develop data structure for following force
  - [X] (re)name attributes appropriately
  - [X] implement simple attribute reading interface in amsi
  - [X] add test case for attribute information retrieval for ALL attributes
* TODO [2/5] add fiber_type and fiber params to simMacro attdefs
  DEADLINE: <2016-02-12 Fri>
  - [X] design data structure for specification
  - [X] implement data structure in simModSuite attdefs
  - [ ] design functionality to parse info at macroscale and send to relevant micro-scale
    - NOTE: should be standalone functionality in case we want to specify
            info for single-scale micro sims using simmertix models (redev)
  - [ ] implement functionality in single-scale code
  - [ ] implement functionality in multi-scale code
    - NOTE: should ammount to just adding to communication primitives
