* TODO [0/1] Get better understanding of current failure mechanism of the code
  - [ ] look at failure points in Victor's runs on the bgq
* TODO [5/6] run using 4 racks of AMOS BG/Q
  - [X] generate 1m mesh
  - [X] partition mesh to 1024 parts
  - [X] move to AMOS
  - [X] queue run
  - [X] failed, reruning to determine if mesh size has an immediate impact
  - [ ] rerun with 128k mesh failed, so memory allocation error is related to parallel scaling
* TODO [1/2] AMSI Ground-up refactor
  - [X] Create new git repo
  - [ ] Development plan
* TODO [5/10] General code improvements
  - [X] allow the subtype of the boundary conditions to look for to be queriable using the field type and the boundary condition type
  - [ ] hide the usage of the simmetrix pACase in building the BCQueries, as well as their application (somehow)
    - [ ] building the BCQueries might need to use some dynamic polymorphism to hide the extra data required for the simmetrix queries (the pACase)
  - [X] different random seed depending on rank
  - [ ] Split template implementation and declaration into xx.h and xx_impl.h files
  - [X] Get rid of the Analysis namespace
  - [X] rename Biotissue namespace to bio
  - [ ] Rename the interface library to the analysis library
  - [X] eliminate all warnings in biotissue
  - [ ] replace old sparse matrix implementation in biotissue with new one in amsi_red
   - [ ] make standalone lib with test cases
  - [ ] make sure that petsc is not allocating memory on the fly
  - [ ] pull the mesh adaptation stuff outside of the fea class, make them functions
* TODO [0/6] Add regression test cases
  - [ ] apf field operation test cases
  - [ ] linear_elastic_regression
  - [ ] nonlinear_elastic_regression
  - [ ] partitioned_linear_elastic_regression
  - [ ] uniform_adapt_regression?
  - [ ] error_estimator_regression?
* DONE [4/4] add fiber_type and fiber params to simMacro attdefs
  - [X] design data structure for specification
  - [X] implement data structure in simModSuite attdefs
  - [X] design functionality to parse info at macroscale and send to relevant micro-scale
    - NOTE: should be standalone functionality in case we want to specify
            info for single-scale micro sims using simmertix models (redev)
  - [X] implement functionality in multi-scale code
    - NOTE: should ammount to just adding to communication primitives
* DONE [8/8] add follow force to simMacro attdefs
  - [X] email cameron about language spec
  - [X] develop data structure for following force
  - [X] (re)name attributes appropriately
  - [X] implement simple attribute reading interface in amsi
  - [X] add test case for attribute information retrieval for ALL attributes
  - [X] make boundary condition test cases
  - [X] compare boundary condition test cases
  - [X] incorporate new boundary condition methods into finite element codes
* DONE [10/10] get amsi test cases back into working order

* DONE [3/3] rework the amsi initialization system
  DEADLINE: <2016-02-12 Fri>
  - [X] figure out component-based alternative to objects which the user is forced to initialize
  - [X] implement alternative
  - [X] modify all executables and test cases to use new interface(s)

* DONE [1/1] 1-file multi-scale comm test case  for 16k processes
  - [X] determine if test is even required (16k element, 128 macro run)

* check valgrind output for memory leaks
